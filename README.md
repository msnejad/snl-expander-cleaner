# snl-expander-cleaner
Using the wizard of SNL addin in excel is complicated, especcially when you need same data for several of periods. This excel VBA code allows you to first retrieve pariticular data for only one period, then expand it for as many periods as you need.

Then using the python function, you can clean the SNL exported data.
